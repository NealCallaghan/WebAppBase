This project is a combination of a bootstrapped Create React App and various tools and configurations that will hopefully allow for production development straight away.

## ESlint

Included is eslint, together with the Airbnb linting rules slightly modified.

## MaterialUI

MaterialUI from google is provided as a bases for out of the box react components.

## React-Redux

React-Redux is included as an application state management system.

## Jest

Jest is provided and setup as a mocking, test runner and assertion library. Various Jest plugins have also been provided to make your linting experience smoother. [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

## Enzyme

In conjunction with Jest Enzyme is included as a tool to allow you to unit test you’re components in a virtual dom, see [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/).

## React-Router

react-router is also included for routing.

## React-Intl

From yahoo react-intl is provided for localization see [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl)

## Redux DevTools

The project is also setup out of the box to use the Redux DevTools, this will allow you to view the applications state as the user interacts with the application. see [redux devtools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)


The application has examples throughout on using the various libraries mentioned.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
